Working on the knowledge base class for step 1.
For now I am going to use the parameter from the paper which seems to make more sense.

Also I am writing proper test files for every function to make everything a bit more robust

Added the goal spaces for the agent. Probably still need to refine this a bit.

Working on the outcome. This is the information saved for each rollout which is used for training the policies and nn search.

Further defined the goal spaces with more logical choices. Currently used the rollouts needed to retrieve the goal. If retrieved in a small amount of time the reward is higher.
Also refined the outcomes based on this.

Added tests for the goal_spaces.py.

Made the agent perform its rollouts and added some statistics to the rollouts.
