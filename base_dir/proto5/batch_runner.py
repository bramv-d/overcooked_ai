"""
Fire off many `run_rollout.py` jobs in parallel.

Notes
-----
* Uses ThreadPoolExecutor because each worker just waits for an external
  process; Python threads are fine for that.
* If `run_rollout.py` itself is heavy CPU work and you want *one process
  per core*, switch to `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`.
